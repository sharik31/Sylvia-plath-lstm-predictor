# üß† Sylvia Plath Poetry ‚Äì Next Word Predictor using LSTM

This project is a deep learning-based next-word prediction model trained on the poetic and emotionally rich text of **Sylvia Plath**, along with select lines from Shakespeare. Using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, the model attempts to complete poetic lines, preserving the unique style and vocabulary of the author.

## üìù Dataset

The model was trained on a hand-curated corpus that includes:
- Sylvia Plath's poem *Mirror* and other poetic fragments
- Shakespearean monologues from *As You Like It*

This fusion of poetic language enriches the vocabulary and rhythm of the predicted output.
